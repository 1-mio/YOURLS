# Contributing to this project

Please take a moment to review this document, or see your issue / pull request closed with *harsh comments*.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of
the developers managing and developing for free this open source project during their free time. In return,
they will reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing
patches and features. Right?

# Using the issue tracker = search before

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for bug reports, features requests and submitting pull
requests, but please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests. Use sites such as
  [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) instead.
* Please, please, please, **SEARCH** before you file a new issue or request.


# Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.
2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest [master](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/archive/master.zip)
3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; create a reduced step-by-step test
   case
4. **Give details** that are relevant to the bug: OS used? browser and server software versions?
   What is the   expected output? What do you see instead? 
   
A good bug report **must not** leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Or your issue will be closed with *harsh comments*.

# Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong
case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please
provide as much detail and context as possible and get in touch.

# Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.
implementing features, refactoring code... ), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owner to
license your work under the same license as that used by the project.
